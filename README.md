# Server Path Field plugin for Craft CMS 3.x

A dropdown field that lets you select a directory in the public webroot of a craftCMS project. It's possible to define a root path (within the webroot) and filter multiple directories.

## Requirements

This plugin requires Craft CMS 3.0.0 or later.

## Installation

To install the plugin, follow these instructions.

1. Open your terminal and go to your Craft project:

        cd /path/to/project

2. Then tell Composer to load the plugin:

        composer require amkdev/server-path-field

3. In the Control Panel, go to Settings ‚Üí Plugins and click the ‚ÄúInstall‚Äù button for Server Path Field.

## Server Path Field Overview

Server Path Field adds a custom FieldType to Craft CMS called Server Path. This lets you choose from any direcotry found in the webroot, which then returns the path as twig value. 

This plugin is basic and not so useful as standalone, but it extends the possiblities of other extensions need a specific public path. For instance [Server Files](https://github.com/amkdev/server-files) or [GetFiles](https://github.com/amkdev/craft-getfiles).
